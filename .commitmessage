chore: release v1.0.4

* inital version


## iobroker app compatibility 
The widgets works perfect in my self compiled version of the iobroker cordova app for android. The widgets only use the socket io connection from VIS.  Only the export functions of highcharts do not work under Cordova.

However, due to licensing restrictions on the commercial use of highcharts, it is unlikely that this adapter will be included in the official Android app. 

## License
This adapter based on highcharts and highstock. These are commercial products, which require to obain a appropriate licence. Please check https://www.highcharts.com/license for licensing.
Non commercial use of highcharts and highstock is currently free under a Creative Commons (CC) Attribution-Non-Commercial license.

During the installation of this adapter the npm package highcharts will automaticaly downloaded and the required files are copied to the widget directory.
